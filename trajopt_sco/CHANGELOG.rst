  * Clang format
  * Remove duplicate osqp depend.
  Co-authored-by: Levi Armstrong <levi.armstrong@gmail.com>
* Compose triplet vector directly
* initialize sparse matrix using vectors of triples instead of coeffRef
* Available solvers priority is set by the ModelType Value enum so make BPMPD last due to license
* Add compiler defines to the target instead of cpp file
* Revert use of unique_ptr for osqpworkspace
* Fix issue in osqp interface to update osqp_data object with new A and P
* Add LP format printing to OSQP solver (`#161 <https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/trajopt/issues/161>`_)
  * Add LP format printing to OSQP solver
  Create a few helpers in osqp_printing and use those when solving fails.
  * Remove OSQP printing
  * Mark writeToFile const and implement it for OSQP
  * Revert change in iostream include
  * Fix redundant string initialization
* Replace OSQPWorkspace* with unique_ptr
  This is meant to handle the memory management of the OSQPWorkspace in a single location.
* Add A and P as unique ptrs to OSQP interface
* Change Eigen arguments that are passed by value to reference
* Add NOLINT to freeing c members
* Fix OSQP Interface for Clang-tidy
  This includes changing the index stored in VarRep to a std::size_t from an int.
* Add trajopt_sco depend on osqp
* Change OSQP to the default solver after Gurobi
  This is due to licensing restrictions. Now the default solver will have a permissive license. BPMPD is still included and can be enabled by setting convex_solver to BPMPD.
* Just some formatting
* Use triangular matrices and throw if setup fails
* Update interface to OSQP 0.6.0
* Add merit coeff to print out and fix error in cntsToCosts function
* Fix clang-tidy errors
* Rebase Fixes
* Inflate only constraints that fail
  This changes the default behavior of the SQP optimizer to only inflate the merit coefficients associated with constraints that are not satisfied. This should make it less important that the constraints have been manually balanced.
* Add new_exact to Trajopt debug output
  While you could get this information by comparing across iterations, I find it convenient to have both side by side.
* Remove missed line when replacing for loop in optimizers.cpp
* Change how unit test are ran
* Add missing cmake install for bpmpd_caller
* Address remaining warnings
* Update based on Clang-Tidy
* Update based on Clang-Tidy and Clazy

* Fix kinetic c++11 cmake flag
* Add cmake support for xenial builds
* Add console_bridge and remove rosconsole and fix tests
* Clean up config.cmake and update due to changes in tesseract
* Fixes in gurobi interface
  change string to std::string and some minor clang fixes. There are still more clang warnings that need to be addressed.
* Set OSQP verbosity to false
  This keeps it from spamming the terminal when running TrajOpt many times in a row.
* Fix test warnings
* Add target specific compiler flags
* Fix formatting using clang
* Add additional compiler warning options
* Merge pull request `#40 <https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/trajopt/issues/40>`_ from arocchi/add_free_solvers_upstream

* Merge remote-tracking branch 'levi/kinetic-devel' into add_free_solvers_upstream
* Remove the use of 'using namespace'
* small refactor towards clang / roscpp guidelines
* Fixed memory leaks in osqp solver
* Made qpOASES solver more robust.
  Notice this should be reviewed after bpmpd is removed and all memory
  alignment problems are resolved. In fact, right now the solver is
  occasionally instantiated twice in each solve cycle: this makes
  test pass.
* Fixed availableSolvers()
* Changed order of preference for solvers: Gurobi > bpmpd > osqp > qpOASES
  Notice that while this change seems trivial, it actually causes tests to pass.
  Since bpmpd interface is quite brittle, it was the case that using it as a third option
  in tests caused some of them to fail. This means the order of execution of tests
  has an influence on the solver, which is a bad sign.
* Tests that use optimize() now run for all available solvers
* Tests that use optimize() will now run for all solvers automatically
* Disabled test with negative matrix, tuned osqp to work with nilpotent matrix
* Added qpOASES interface and tests
* Added osqp solver and changed default logging level.

  * Refactored the scaling fix to use expression operations
* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/trajopt/issues/3>`_ from johnwason/kinetic-devel
