/**
 *  @file test_vars_constr_cost.h
 *
 *  @brief Example to generate a solver-independent formulation for the problem, taken
 *  from the IPOPT cpp_example.
 *
 *  The example problem to be solved is given as:
 *
 *      min_x f(x) = -(x1-2)^2
 *      s.t.
 *           0 = x0^2 + x1 - 1
 *           -1 <= x0 <= 1
 *
 * In this simple example we only use one set of variables, constraints and
 * cost. However, most real world problems have multiple different constraints
 * and also different variable sets representing different quantities. This
 * framework allows to define each set of variables or constraints absolutely
 * independently from another and correctly stitches them together to form the
 * final optimization problem.
 *
 * For a helpful graphical overview, see:
 * http://docs.ros.org/api/ifopt/html/group__ProblemFormulation.html
