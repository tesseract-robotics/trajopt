 * @brief Controls how a component should represent "range" bounds (both lower and upper bounds).

 * @code
 *   lb <= g(x) <= ub
 * @endcode
 *
 * Downstream formulations (e.g., slack-variable handling or certain QP/SQP builders) may prefer
 * representing this as two separate inequality rows:
 * @code
 *   g(x) >= lb
 *   g(x) <= ub
 * @endcode
 *
 * This enum specifies whether to keep range bounds as a single row or to split them into two
 * inequality rows when building the constraint representation.
 *
 * @note This setting typically only affects rows whose bounds are true ranges (finite lower and
 *       finite upper with lb < ub). Equality bounds (lb == ub) and one-sided bounds are usually
 *       unchanged.
