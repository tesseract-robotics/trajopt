 * @brief The DiscreteCombineCollisionData struct
 * @warning Make sure that the values returned are not just the violation but the constraint values.
 * Remember the values are the constant in the quadratic function, so if you only return the
 * violation then if it is not violating the constraint this would be zero which means it
 * will always appear to be on the constraint boundary which will cause issue when solving.
 * If it is not voliating the constraint then return the max negative number.
 * If no contacts are found return the negative of the collision margin buffer. This is why
 * it is important to not set the collision margin buffer to zero.
